These are a collection of my hobby notes/work/writings.

## Physics related stuff
- A discussion on the double pendulum problem. [Julia notebook](https://github.com/amiragha/notes/blob/master/physics/double_pendulum.ipynb)

   The picture is the double pendulum problem started with 20 different but extremely close initial conditions to illustrate the chaotic behavior.
